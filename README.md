# Converse
A unit converter app for cooking (Optional task in Developers Android)

I used a litte bit of a help from chatGPT for the spinners since i dont know anything about spinners. Originally, i had my own code to solve to conversion but it was pretty limited since it only uses milliliter as base unit.

Thanks for stopping by !
