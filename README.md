# Converse
A unit converter app for cooking (Optional task in Developers Android)

I use a litte bit of a guidance from chatGPT for the Spinner since i dont know anything about spinner. Originally i have my own code to solve to conversion but it was pretty limited since it only uses milliliter as base unit.

Thanks for stopping by !
